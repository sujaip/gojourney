Everything we do with Go like compiling, formatting and etc are taken care by the go tool

GOPATH
$ echo $GOPATH
/home/vagrant/gohome

$ go install hello
Here go looks for a src/hello directory under GOPATH, that contains the source code for hello.

$ go build hello
Here the go tool just builds the hello source, it does not install it.

$ go run ./my_code/main.go
go run expects full path to a go file instead of a package

$ go fmt hello
src/hello/main.go
go fmt formatts the package source to enfore the standard style

$ go vet hello
src/hello/main.go:29: arg i for printf verb %s of wrong type: main.stringSlice
exit status 1
/* Here we tried to print a string slice as a string for this example */

$ go test hello
$ go help test
